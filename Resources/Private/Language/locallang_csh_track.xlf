				<source><![CDATA[A track represents a single piece of music. Depending on the usage of the track model it can be either used as a stand-alone representation of a music track (like a single) or as a part of an album and/or part of a recording.

				<b>Stand-alone</b>
				If used stand-alone the track can have a download relation if a download link for that track exists.

				<b>Part of an album</b>
				If used as part of an album the relation to the download model should not be set as the download relation is being managed through the album model instead.

				<b>Part of a recording</b>
				If used as part of a recording the relation to the download model should not be set as the download relation is being managed through the recording model instead.]]></source>
